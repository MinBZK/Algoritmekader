"""
Hook to fetch and deploy security.txt file during MkDocs build.

This hook:
1. Attempts to fetch security.txt from NCSC (https://www.ncsc.nl/.well-known/security.txt)
2. Updates the Canonical field to point to our own domain
3. Places the file in .well-known/security.txt in the built site
4. Falls back to a basic security.txt if the fetch fails
